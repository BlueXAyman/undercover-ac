For educational purposes, please do not use this autoclicker to cheat. I only made this for fun


How to use?

Download Calm.exe from releases

When opened, you can see 2 options
First one you type the amount of CPS you want, for example 1 is 1cps, 0.1 is 10cps etc..
Second one is what keyboard key is going to trigger the autoclicker, when you press start and hold that key, the autoclicker will work (only when key is being held down)
